// Leaf-level diff of two field values in a `.tree` record. The semantic diff (see
// ./diff) records which field changed and its whole before and after value, matched by
// mark, not by text line. This turns one such change into the right kind of intra-leaf
// diff for display and blame: a text value is diffed at word granularity (finer than a
// line), while a number is an atomic typed value that changed from one to another, not a
// string to pick digits out of, so it is reported as a whole before-and-after. Anything
// else (a reference, boolean, date, blob, collection, or nested record) is atomic too.
//
// This is the display counterpart to the word-level merge in ./../merge, which combines
// disjoint edits to the same text field. Both run on the parsed value at the leaf, never
// on raw `.tree` text.
