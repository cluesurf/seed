/**
 * JSON as base values, both ways, losing nothing.
 *
 * Every JSON that reaches base goes through here: a `jsonb` column mirrored from a
 * database, a page body posted by an editor, an importer's rows. One lifter and one
 * lowerer, because two converters disagree eventually, and the disagreement is a field
 * present on one path and absent on the other.
 *
 * THE LAW, held by `test/json-bridge.test.ts`: `lowerJson(liftJson(x))` deep-equals `x`
 * for every JSON `x`, and `liftJson(lowerJson(v))` is value-equal to `v` for every lifted
 * `v`. Before this module the projection lowered a record as `{ type, ...fields }` and an
 * integer as a string, so a page body came back out of base as something the page's own
 * checker refused.
 *
 * LIFTING IS DIRECTED BY THE FORM when one is in hand. A JSON object under a property
 * declared `{ record: 'content_heading' }` becomes a record of that type; one under a
 * union form becomes a record of the arm its discriminant names; a number under
 * `{ base: 'decimal' }` stays a decimal even when it happens to be whole. With no form
 * (a column base has no declaration for) the shape rules below apply and the record type
 * is `object`. Both paths lower identically, because the type is never written into the
 * JSON: a content node keeps its `form` key as an ordinary field, and that key is what
 * re-picks the arm on the way back in.
 *
 * IDENTITY IS THE `id` FIELD, at any depth, and nothing else. An object carrying an `id`
 * that reads as a mark (a tone code or a uuid) becomes a marked record, the `id` key is
 * taken out of its fields, and a list item holding it merges by identity. An object
 * without one is positional, deliberately: no `mark` field is invented and nothing is
 * minted onto content. An `id` that is neither spelling stays an ordinary text field, so
 * a foreign document with its own `id` vocabulary is not mistaken for one of ours.
 *
 * THE ONE EXCEPTION IS A FORM THAT DECLARES `id` AS A PROPERTY. A row form never does (a
 * row's `id` column is its mark and is left out of the form), and most value forms never
 * do, so the rule above holds everywhere it is meant to. But a `content_reference` node
 * carries `id` as the id of the record it POINTS AT, beside `base` and `slug`, and two
 * references to the same language must not become one node. When the form in hand says
 * `id` is a field, it is a field, and the object is positional like any other.
 *
 * Marks are stored as hex uuids and lowered as tone codes, which is the platform's
 * presentation form. See `canon/mark.ts`.
 *
 * See note/plan/wordsurf-json-base.md.
