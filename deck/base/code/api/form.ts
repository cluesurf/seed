// Form registration: declaring what a repository's records look like, and versioning it.
//
// A form is a schema. Registering one is the moment a restructuring becomes visible to
// everyone downstream, so this is where a breaking change is CAUGHT rather than where it
// is discovered later by a projection going NULL.
//
// The rule is that registration never silently breaks a registered consumer. A change that
// removes a property some contract reads is refused unless the caller says the break is
// intended, and even then the affected consumers are named in the answer so they can be
// pinned. That is the difference between a schema registry and a filing cabinet.
//
// See note/library/base/design/restructuring-records.md and consumer-contracts.md.
